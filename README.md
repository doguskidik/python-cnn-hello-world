The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.You will discover how to develop a convolutional neural network for handwritten digit classification from scratch.

## You will know:

* How to develop a test harness to develop a robust evaluation of a model and establish a baseline of performance for a classification task.
* How to explore extensions to a baseline model to improve learning and model capacity.
* How to develop a finalized model, evaluate the performance of the final model, and use it to make predictions on new images.
